📌 Project Objective :-

  The High-Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) Project is designed to ensure business continuity, minimize downtime, and protect critical applications/data from system failures or catastrophic events. This setup combines high availability (maintaining uptime through redundancy and failover) with disaster recovery (restoring services quickly after outages or disasters). The goal is to provide a resilient IT infrastructure that supports uninterrupted services and quick recovery from failures.

📌 Project Description:-
Objective


 • Deliver an always-available, fault-tolerant infrastructure.

• Ensure data safety and quick recovery during outages.

• Maintain business operations with minimal downtime (low RTO/RPO).

Setup Components

• Primary & Secondary Sites: Geographically separated.

• Networking: Load balancers and DNS failover with health checks.

• Applications: Deployed in clusters or containers (e.g., Kubernetes).

• Databases: Replication and failover enabled.

• Backups: Automated daily/weekly, stored in secure cloud storage.

• Monitoring: Tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana for health checks.

• Automation: Failover scripts and runbooks for quick disaster response.

Workflow:-

• Normal operations run from the Primary Site.

• Data is continuously replicated to the DR Site.

• During outages, traffic is automatically redirected to the DR Site.

• Teams use documented DR Playbooks for failover/failback procedures.

📌 Architecture Flow :-
The architecture typically includes:


• Primary Data Center (Active Site): o Hosts production workloads and services. o Configured for high availability with load balancers, clustering, and replication.

• Secondary Data Center / DR Site (Passive or Active-Active): o Located in a geographically separate region. o Contains replicated systems, applications, and data for disaster recovery.

• Load Balancers: o Distribute traffic across multiple servers and ensure service continuity during failover.

• Database Replication: o Real-time or asynchronous replication between primary and secondary databases.

📌 Benefits of This Setup:-


• High Availability: Ensures applications remain online with minimal service disruption.

• Disaster Resilience: Provides quick recovery from natural disasters, outages, or cyberattacks.

• Data Protection: Continuous replication and secure backups safeguard business-critical data.

• Scalability: The architecture can scale horizontally (adding servers) or vertically (enhancing resources).

• Automation: Failover and monitoring reduce manual intervention and response time.

• Compliance & Business Continuity: Meets compliance standards for industries requiring strict uptime and data integrity (e.g., finance, healthcare).

• Customer Trust: Builds confidence by ensuring services are reliable and available 24/7.

• Storage & Backup System: o Centralized backup repository with scheduled snapshots. o Cloud or on-premises storage to secure copies of critical data.

• Monitoring & Automation: o Automated monitoring tools detect failures and trigger failover processes. o Alerting systems to notify teams in case of outages
